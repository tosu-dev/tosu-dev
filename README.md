## Presentation ‚ú®
Hello there, my name is Th√©o Constant and I'm a young french passionate junior developer.

I started programming in middle school. My brother passed on his passion for computers to me. The very first time I code was in VBS thanks to a random youtube video I saw on how to do a little game. I just copied the code from the description and test it. Then I started to do a lot of tiny projects in Scratch, and I used to annoy my math teacher by showing him those projects.

In highschool, I learned Python and Java by myself and start doing personal projects like Python game or Minecraft plugins while having computer courses. I also did 2 Hackathons during highschool.

I'm currently in a Bachelor of Computer Science in the IUT of Paris - Rives de Seine and in apprenticeship in Linedata.

For 2024-2025, I'm in ESGI (Ecole Sup√©rieur de G√©nie Informatique) for a virtual reality and game developpement course.

This Github is my workspace for personnal, school, and event projects.
