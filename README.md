# Bonjour le Monde ! 🌍

## Presentation ✨
Hello there, my name is Théo Constant and I'm a young passionate junior developer.

I started programming in middle school. The very first time I code was in vbs thanks to a random youtube video I saw on how to do an little game. I just copied the code from the description and test it. Then I started to do a lot of tiny projects in Scratch, and I used to annoy my math teacher by showing him those projects.

In highschool, I learned python and java by myself and start doing personnal projects like python game or minecraft plugins while having computer courses. I also did 2 Hackathons during highschool.

I'm currently in a Bachelor of Computer Science in the IUT of Paris - Rives de Seine and in apprenticeship in Linedata.

This Github is my workspace for personnal, school, and event projects.
