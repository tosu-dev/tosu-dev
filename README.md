## About me ðŸ˜ƒ
My name is ThÃ©o Constant, aka tosu-dev. I'm a young junior developer and an informatic student.

I'm passionate about informatic since middle school. I started to learn on my own, with Youtube videos and OpenClassroom formations. The first program I have made is a Visual Basic Script code that ask your name and your age and reply a sentence with those informations in it. My favorite language is Python by far, but I really like Java and C/C++.



I'm currently searching for an informatic sandwich course (alternance) about applications and video games development.
