## Presentation ðŸ˜ƒ
My name is ThÃ©o Constant, aka tosu-dev. I'm a young junior developer and an informatic student.

I'm passionate about informatic since middle school. I started to learn on my own, with Youtube videos and OpenClassroom formations. 

The first program I have made is a Visual Basic Script code that ask your name and your age and reply a sentence with those informations in it. 

My favorite language is Python by far, but I really like Java and C/C++.

I'm not sure of what I clearly want to do, because I love all the aspect of informatics, so I'm trying to learn the most and choose what I prefer. It seems to be game and application developpement.

I'm currently searching for an informatic sandwich course (alternance) about applications and video games development.
